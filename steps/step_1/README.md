# Step 1b - for those trying this at their own pace.

To follow along with the session, we'll assume you're familiar with Linux or OSX. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adapt the commands as appropriate.

To follow along, you'll need the following:

1. An AWS account and credentials for use with AWS CLI
2. The following should be installed on your machine:
    * Terraform
    * AWS CLI
    * Hugo - see the [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/installation/) for installation instructions
    * An editor - we recommend VSCode, but you can use your favourite editor.

If you're not familiar with Terraform, AWS CLI or Hugo, we recommend you take a look at the documentation for each before proceeding.
